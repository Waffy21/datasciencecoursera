## What is?

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of our size status, allowing us easily to realize if we have to change
our lifestyle in order to be in a more appropiate weight for our height.

## Calculation

If you want to obtain your BMI, you have to measure your weight and height. After that, you only have to use this formula:

$$\frac{weight(kg)}{height(m)^2}$$

## Results

After obtaining your BMI, its neccesary to classify your result:

Lower than 18.5: Underweight

Between 18.5 and 25: Optimal

25 up to 30: Overweight

30 upwards: Obese

## Example

Let's do a simple example to understand this:

Just imagine a random person with this parameters:

Weight: 65kg
Height: 1.75m

$$BMI = \frac{65}{1.75^2}$$

```{r}
BMI = 65/(1.75^2)

print(BMI)
```
So we can conclude this person is in his happy weight!
